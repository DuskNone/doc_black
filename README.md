Black CSS theme for google docs

Alright...

so if you have a browser that supports chrome extensions, you need to install **Amino CSS.**
Link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amino-live-css-editor/pbcpfbcibpcbfbmddogfhcijfpboeaaf?hl=en

Then go to https://docs.google.com
You should see the extension icon in the top left.
Open the panel > Domain
Then just paste the content from css_theme.txt into the textbox, hit save and...

You're done :)
